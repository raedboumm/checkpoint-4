# Palindrome Checker

## Problem Description

This program checks if a given word is a palindrome. A word is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards as it does backwards. For instance, the following words are palindromes: `gag`, `kayak`, `php`, and `radar`.

### Methodology

To determine if a word is a palindrome:
1. Compare the first and last characters of the word.
2. If they are the same, then check the remaining inner substring.
3. If they are different, the word is not a palindrome.
4. If the word's length becomes 0 or 1, it is considered a palindrome.
